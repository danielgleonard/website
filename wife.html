                <p>
                    I figure if I’m going to be within shooting distance of you, I
                    better try some diplomacy before I arrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know this is all crazy for you, it’s all crazy for me, and
                    it’s double crazy for Laura, who is the person I’m trying to
                    protect and accommodate most of all in this process. People
                    fall in love and people fall out of love and love changes all
                    the time, but rarely for one person do they have so many things
                    to consider, so many people to love, give attention to, and
                    please as Laura does.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s also rare to come across the one person you truly believe
                    you’re meant to be with, and not only have her married and with
                    kids to boot, but also 2000 miles away in another sovereign
                    nation. This isn’t a fling or a tryst or an affair, it’s two
                    people bring bowled over by discovering a deep wellspring of
                    powerful emotions, and a connection that they never thought
                    possible. I don’t covet Laura, want to make her mine alone, or
                    steal her away as much as I want to find any way possible to be
                    in her light and warmth, and to nurture her, protect her, and
                    grow with her, for me, and for everyone else, as much as I can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don’t judge people, ever. Laura doesn’t badmouth you, you’re
                    not some loser guy we scheme against in our private
                    conversations. Through everything she’s shown that she loves
                    you deeply and wants to continue a large portion of the life
                    you’ve built together with Asa, but also explore and grow in
                    other ways. It was hard for me to accept at first too, but I’ve
                    done so, because again, she’s just that god damned incredible a
                    human being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So yeah. That’s where we are. I don’t expect or anticipate a
                    response, our relationship can be as distant or as friendly as
                    we want going forward, when things are settled and comfortable
                    and people adjusted. Life is crazy, and hard, but most unfair
                    of all, short, and these connections and emotions don’t reveal
                    themselves every day, it’d be so self-damaging not to pursue it,
                    it’s a thought I can’t even tolerate, and I think you’ll find
                    Laura feels the same way, and what’s more will have the chance
                    to grow and explore in other ways that she can share with
                    everyone she loves.
